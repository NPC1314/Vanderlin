/* Notes: the global lists copied to the main files, seems to work better when loaded there.

Adventurer and pilgrim jobs - Vanderlin ones commented out in their files. Its either that, untick them, or make new duplicate adv job branches.
This causes some conflicts when updated, but its easy to solve. Just accept both changes if it happens, make sure file is still commented out, done.
Migrant waves : same as above

The regular jobs disabled via the config lines in this document. That method doesnt work with advclasss or migrant waves.
The new jobs use the /datum/outfit/job/sk typepath for outfits so they are easy to find in the select euipment drop down admin menu (rclick mob for it)
They also use /stonekeep/ in their datum path to be easily sortable.

Some jobs moved to waves, the more exotic/foreign ones mostly belong there to avoid oversaturation.

Logic of social groupings: The job groupings are consistently by social grouping now, as in the social unit the role belongs to. A butler might not be a noble but they will belong
to the Court social group in all respects and thats the only useful grouping. Only drawback is one has to keep an eye on mechanics relating to these groupings, should they be added by someone else.
Thus the jobs in the noble_positions are labeeld as court and will primarily listen to the Monarch and then the Hand. The garrison boss is the Sheriff. The Temple boss is the Priest.
The word serf means something completely different than what the original maker of this list thought, its used for the burghers now, the "middle-class", the tradesmen, the guilds members.
